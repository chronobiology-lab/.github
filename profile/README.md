# Chronobiology Lab

## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the research group led by [Your Name]. We focus on three main domains: developmental chronobiology, sleep epidemiology, and light and visual neuroscience. Our research aims to understand the intricate relationships between sleep, light exposure, and cognition in both humans and animals.

## Domains

### Developmental Chronobiology
In this domain, we investigate how sleep develops and the various prenatal and postnatal factors that influence this process. Factors such as light exposure, maternal behavior, and seasonal variations are explored to uncover their roles in regulating sleep patterns.

### Sleep Epidemiology
Our group utilizes statistical modeling to explore the associations between sleep characteristics and aging, cognition, neurodegeneration, and mental health. We delve into biological, environmental, and social factors that impact biological rhythms in humans, leading to the development of interventions aimed at improving sleep in individuals with mental health disorders.

### Light and Visual Neuroscience
Our focus includes real-world studies utilizing wearable light exposure monitors and mobile phone apps for longitudinal cognitive data collection. We develop portable light exposure monitors. We investigate individual differences in light sensitivities using pupillometry and psychophysics visual tasks. Our recent endeavors also extend to establishing new standards for measuring light for animals, considering their ocular anatomy and photoreceptor sensitivities.
